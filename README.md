## What you get

Run nexus-mapper on a repository once. It writes a `.nexus-map/` directory with everything an AI needs to understand the codebase — architecture, boundaries, hot files, dependency graph. Next time you open a chat window, the AI reads one file and already knows where everything lives.

```
.nexus-map/
├── INDEX.md              ← Load this first. Full architectural context, under 2000 tokens.
├── arch/
│   ├── systems.md        ← Every subsystem: what it owns, exactly where it sits in the repo.
│   └── dependencies.md   ← How components connect. Rendered as a Mermaid dependency graph.
├── concepts/
│   ├── concept_model.json ← Machine-readable knowledge graph. Structured for programmatic use.
│   └── domains.md        ← The domain language this codebase speaks, in plain terms.
├── hotspots/
│   └── git_forensics.md  ← Files that change constantly, and pairs that always change together.
│                           These are where bugs hide and where changes break things.
└── raw/                  ← Source data: AST nodes, git statistics, filtered file tree.
```

`INDEX.md` is the entry point. It is intentionally small — an AI can load it in full without truncation, and then navigate to deeper files as needed.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check |
|-------------|-------|
| Python 3.10+ | `python --version` |
| Shell execution | Your AI client must support running terminal commands |

A git repository is recommended but not required. Without git history, the `hotspots/` analysis is skipped; everything else runs normally.

**Install script dependencies before first use:**

```bash
pip install -r .agent/skills/nexus-mapper/scripts/requirements.txt
```

---

## Install

```bash
npx skills add haaaiawd/nexus-mapper
```

Works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, and any client that reads `SKILL.md`.

---

## Usage

Point your AI at a local repository path:

```
Analyze /Users/me/projects/my-app and generate a knowledge map
```

The AI runs the analysis, then writes `.nexus-map/` into the repository root. The next time you — or any other AI — needs to work on that codebase, start with:

```
Read .nexus-map/INDEX.md
```

That's the full context, compressed and ready.

---

## Language support

Parses 17+ languages automatically by file extension.

Python · JavaScript · JSX · TypeScript · TSX · Java · Go · Rust · C++ · C · C# · Kotlin · Ruby · Swift · Scala · PHP · Lua · Elixir

Unknown extensions are skipped silently. Mixed-language repositories work without any configuration.
